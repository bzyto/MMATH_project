Finite element PDE solver
This is my Finite ELement PDE solver. I am developing the code for my final year MMath project at the University of Manchester. 
The final goal is to solve the biharmonic equation. To do that we have to implement an element that is C1 cont. This can be achieved by taking a Z3 element, that is almost working by now, and enforcing additional values on the edges.
Maybe we will deal with boundary conditions some day.
